# DSA_Project
Data Structure and Algorithm Project, 4th Semester

### make instructions ($ meaning shell, do not add $ in command line)
`$ make` - to compile the program\
`$ make run` - to run the build/executable\
`$ make reset` - delete the executable to reset and run `make` again to create 
new executable\

### Notes:
- The makefile has been configured for linux only for now, will need to add
windows commmands before submitting it in the final project.
- Also need to work on a script to auto-install all the required libraries 
since teachers will probably test out the program on other OSes except linux
and also script for linux (python comes to mind).
