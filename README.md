### Make instructions
`make` - to compile the program\
`make run` - to run the build/executable\
`make reset` - delete the executable to reset and run `make` again to create 
new executable\

### Notes:
- The makefile has been configured for linux only for now.
- Need to work on a script to auto-install all the required libraries
