## Visualization of Quicksort Algorithm & Huffman Tree

### Requirements
- SDL2
- SDL2_ttf (for rendering fonts)
- GNU Make (for building executable)

### Make instructions
`make` - to compile the program\
`make run` - to run the build/executable\
`make clean` - delete the executable to reset and run `make` again to create 
new executable\

### Notes:
- The MakeFile has been configured for Linux only for now.
- Need to work on a script to auto-install all the required libraries.
